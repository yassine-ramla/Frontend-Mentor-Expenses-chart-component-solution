## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS library
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Module Bundler 

### What I learned

when you need to pass a tailwind css class to a react component, tailwind won't generate that class and it won't be applied to the component unless it is generated before for another component

```react
const Comp = ({ height }) => {
  <div
    className={`
      rounded-full
      w-full
      h-[${height}]
    `}
  >
</div>
}

export default Comp;
```
```react
import HomePage from "./pages/homePage";

export default function App() {
  return <Comp height="200px" />;
}
```

this class won't be generated by tailwind css.
the solution I've used is to use the style attribute for the styles i want to pass as arguments:

```react
const Comp = ({ height }) => {
  <div
    className={`
      rounded-full
      w-full
    `}
    style={{
      height: {height};
    }}
  >
</div>
}

export default Comp;
```
